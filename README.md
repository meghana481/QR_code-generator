# QR_code-generator

This Streamlit app generates a QR code from a user-provided URL. It takes the URL input, creates a QR code using the `qrcode` library, converts the image to a PNG byte array, encodes it in base64, and displays it on the page. Additionally, it celebrates the QR code generation with a balloon animation.
